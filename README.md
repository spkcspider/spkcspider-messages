### Implement Emails/messaging
* email to spkcspider transport wrapper (also script)+component (encrypt, transparent gpg)
  * delta chat integration
  * webinterface
* implement webreferences
* WebReference on an "email" object is an "email"

# Why encryption is really a good thing:

Many governments have fear not to be able to see terrorristic attacks in advance if encryption is used.
With good encryption only the targeted audience can read the content and the government is shut out that is right.
But what is if snooping is causing more harm than it helps.
Listening to such content can be harmful for the listener. At some point the facebook
employees responsible for cleaning bad content started to change.
The same change can happen to an eavesdropper.
If someone perfect the technique and has a good empathy for law enforcement the attacker
can launch in-band attacks to misuse the police or secret service as a weapon.
Imagine the power of thousand police officers used for a terrorristic attack.
So dear eavesdropper: please protect your mind and just allow encryption.
There is always an unhealthy temptation to eavesdrop.

## But precrime and AI, ...

Have you heard about Microsoft Tay or the Chinese XiaoBing AI?
They "corrupted" nearly instantly.
Imagine such AIs analyzing conversations and predicting a crime.
Many innocent people are in prisons in short time afterwards.
It is the same effect explained earlier.
